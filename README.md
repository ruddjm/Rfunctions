# Rfunctions
R functions I made over the years to make my work easier. Includes:

   * Data visualization functions in base R (the native graphics package)
   * Functions for extracting relevant info from R model and statistical test objects to make useful, informative tables. 
   * Sample size calculations for a couple of non-trivial studies designs.
