.SD, .BY, .N, .I and .GRP are read only symbols for use in j. .N can be used in i as well.
What does .BY do?


# Add a group index 
dat[ , groupIndex := .GRP, by = .(color, grp)]



dt[ , rownums := .I]

.BY


.I
.I is an integer vector equal to seq_len(nrow(x)). While grouping, it holds for each item in
the group, itâ€™s row location in x. This is useful to subset in j; e.g. DT[, .I[which.max(somecol)], by=grp].






.SDcols
Specifies the columns of x to be included in the special symbol .SD which stands
for Subset of data.table. May be character column names or numeric positions.
This is useful for speed when applying a function through a subset of (possible
very many) columns; e.g., DT[, lapply(.SD, sum), by="x,y", .SDcols=301:350].
For convenient interactive use, the form startcol:endcol is also allowed (as
in by), e.g., DT[, lapply(.SD, sum), by=x:y, .SDcols=a:f]

Using rowSums actually works faster.


---+ by =

Investigate what this does. Will DT have the new variable? Will only rows 1:5 have the value populated? I think yes and yes, and the effect of subsetting to the first 5 rows is that only the rows with values of V1 occurring in rows 1:5 will get a value calculated for V4.sum.
DT[1:5,.(V4.Sum = sum(V4)),by=V1] Calculates the sum of V4, for every group in
V1, after subsetting on the first five rows.
##!! But this does not have any assignment, right?

---++ Assigning variables when using by

Be careful when trying to subset in i and assign a new variable, and trying to use by. I need to look at this more carefully.



# Example of assigning variables with by
# This way doesn't use by, and it doesn't propagate the new variable to each by group.
identify_four_qads[qad1Flag == 1 & (willHaveAnAntibioticTomorrow | willHaveAnAntibioticInTwoDays), 
  hasASecondQad := 1]  



# This does use by, and it does propagate to the other variables.
## Key synapse: in the last example, we used subsetting in i, whereas in the next, using by, we used it in the RHS of the variable assignment.
identify_four_qads[ , 

  hasASecondQad := 
    as.numeric(
    any(qad1Flag == 1) 
    & 
    any((willHaveAnAntibioticTomorrow & qad1Flag == 1) | (willHaveAnAntibioticInTwoDays & qad1Flag == 1))), 
    
  by = .(admission_id, bcx_drawn_day)] 

prev_encounters_dat[ , time_since_last_ip := as.integer(min(time_prev_encounter_to_index_encounter[ip_encounters == 1])), by = patient_id]
Was getting an error about lhs not matching type of rhs. Adding as.integer fixed it, but it doesn't make sense to me.

---+ Sorting

Note that setkey still requires and will always sort only in ascending order, and is different from setorder in that it additionally sets the sorted attribute.

 x[order(.)] is now optimised internally to use data.table's fast order by default.
